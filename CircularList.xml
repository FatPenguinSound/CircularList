            <summary>
            <para>Impliments a FIFO list using a circular data structure.</para>
            <para>The circular list avoids the performance issues with collection copying inherent in the standard data types. This inplimentation is of fixed size and strictly adheres to a FIFO paradigm. There is no support for mid-collection insertion.</para>
            <para>In the event that the list size is exceeded, the oldest entry in the list is overwritten with the newest.</para>
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>Internally, the class uses a typed array to store the data. The data is written or read based on the incrementing of two "pointers" that mark the insertion point for new data and the read point for old data. The pointers can be accessed independently to allow for asynchonous read/write operations, or jointly in a single call.</para>
            <para>If the read pointer catches up to the write pointer, then the object will report no new entries. If the write pointer catches up to the read pointer, then the read pointer is incremented to stay one index ahead of the write pointer. See the <c>Read</c> and <c>Write</c> methods for more information.</para>
